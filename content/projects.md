## projects

A list of projects I'm working on/worked on with links to github.

#### [tophat](https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/tophat)
A game engine made in C, but using [umka](https://github.com/vtereshkov/umka-lang) to make games. It still work in progress, but you can already make games with it. Just prepare to have no sound. It is currently my main project.

#### [lishka](https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/lishka)
A shell I'm trying to make, so it can replace fish's place as my main shell.

#### [mdsite](https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/mdsite)
Mdsite is minimalist static site generator written in go. It packs no useless stuff. It just parses markdown and inserts it into predefined html template. I want to make a qui frontend, so it's easier to use and a vim extension to generate sites straight from vim. It was also used to make this website

#### [cliw](https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/cliw)
Cli canvas library made in go. I plan on making a rewrite in shell.

#### [clengine](https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/clengine)
Clengine is a game endgine built on top of cliw. Although it's still in development, it is fully functional. It handles game cycles with accessible delta, drawing and physics objects. It aims to make the code as simple as possible, while still giving user controll of the project. It also is pain to use and develop. I learnt my lesson and want to not make the same mistakes with tophat :].

#### [goblocks](https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/goblocks)
Goblocks is status bar manager for dwm. It allows for independent update interval, and when it doesn't update anything, it sleeps, so your battery doesn't drain that fast.

#### [mcal](https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/mcal)
Mcal is a calendar made using cliw as an example.

#### [gemmerald](https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/)
Gemmerald is a programming language interptretor. It's not completed, and stuff that works is buggy. I don't think it will ever be completed, since it's just a side project of mine.
