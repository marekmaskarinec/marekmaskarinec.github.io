## projects

#### clengine
Clengine is a cli interface generator. It can be used for creation of games or tui tools.

#### goblocks
Goblocks is status bar manager for dwm. It allows for independent update interval, and when it doesn't update anything, it sleeps, so your battery doesn't drain that fast.

#### cloader
Cloader is an example game made in clengine. I recently broke it, but I'm alredy working on a fix.

#### mcal
Mcal is a calendar made in clengine as an example.

#### clok
Clok is a tool to make development with clengine easier.

#### gemmerald
Gemmerald is a programming language. It's not completed, and stuff that works is buggy. I don't think it will ever be completed, since it's just a side project of mine.
