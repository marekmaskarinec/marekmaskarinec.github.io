## the heavy problem

Although I really like tf2c and I've decided to stop playing live tf2 because of it, there are still some things, I don't like about that mod. I'm sure most of them will eventually fixed except for one, which is
the problem with the current state of heavy. Just to clarify. I main heavy and demo. I also have experience with scout, medic and engie and can play every class pretty well except for sniper and spy (I just don't like them).

#### problem 1: the secondary dillemma
In the Death and Taxes update, heavy has received Sandvich. It's stats are a bit different from live tf2, since it only heals 120 hp. I'm grateful, that the tf2c team added a lunchbox item, since it's the meta
in live tf2 and not just a shotgun with bit tweaked stats and a new model. Unfortunately this brings a dillemma with what secondary to choose. One would say sandvich without thinking, but after playing a bit, you
start thinking, if shotgun would be a better idea.
