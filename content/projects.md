## projects

A list of projects I'm working on/worked on with links to github.

#### [cliw](https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/cliw)
Cliw is a cli interface generator. It can be used for creation of games or tui tools.

#### [clengine](https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/clengine
Clengine is a game endgine built on top of cliw. Although it's still in development, it is fully functional. It handles game cycles with accessible delta, drawing and physics objects. It aims to make the code as simple as possible, while still giving user controll of the project.

#### [goblocks](https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/goblocks)
Goblocks is status bar manager for dwm. It allows for independent update interval, and when it doesn't update anything, it sleeps, so your battery doesn't drain that fast.

#### [cloader](https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/cloader)
Cloader is an example game made using cliw. I recently broke it, but I'm alredy working on a fix.

#### [mcal](https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/mcal)
Mcal is a calendar made using cliw as an example.

#### [mdsite](https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/mdsite)
A simple static site generator, that parses markdown and puts it into premade html template, aiming to be as simple as possible. It was used to create this site :]

#### [gemmerald](https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/)
Gemmerald is a programming language. It's not completed, and stuff that works is buggy. I don't think it will ever be completed, since it's just a side project of mine.
