## software, I use

#### void linux
- it's really fast
- xbps (void package manager) is also really fast
- rolling release
- no systemd

#### dwm
- fast
- organizes windows for me
- looks great
- love customizing it
- patches:
	- alternativetags
	- barpadding
	- cool-autostart
	- fullgaps
	- fullscreen
	- steam

#### fish
- no need to customize, since I like the default config

#### luakit
- it's really good to navigate and it's lightweight

#### vim
- `:wq` makes a good smiley face. still not good as `:]`
