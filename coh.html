<h1>the church of hat</h1>

<p>The church of hat is a community of better people. If you want to join the church of hat, you have to say: &ldquo;Hat is our god and there is nothing better&rdquo;. As a member of the church of hat, you don&rsquo;t wear hat, since you would be using that hat,
but you let the hat wear you. The more hats you own, the better person you are. Memebers only use fedora and rhel as their os and are obligated to force those distros on everyone they meet.</p>
